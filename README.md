This project proposal aims to address the vulnerabilities and challenges faced by traditional voting systems in Kenya by developing a blockchain-enabled voting application. The current voting system in Kenya suffers from issues such as lack of transparency, limited public awareness, and concerns regarding the accuracy and privacy of votes. To overcome these shortcomings, the proposed solution leverages the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and transparency of the electoral process.

## Chapter 1 ‚Äî Introduction
Chapter 1 introduces the research topic, highlighting the background of voting in Kenya and identifying the problem statement. The research aims to develop a secure and transparent platform that guarantees the accuracy, transparency, and privacy of votes.

## Literature Review
The next chapter presents a comprehensive literature review, discussing the shortcomings of traditional voting systems and reviewing existing systems, including blockchain-based voting platforms. The chapter establishes the conceptual framework of the blockchain-enabled voting web application, focusing on the registration, login, voting, and result viewing processes.

## Methodology
The proposal also describes the research methodology employed in the project, which is Object-Oriented Analysis and Design using the Waterfall methodology. The chapter explains the steps involved in the methodology, including requirement gathering and design diagram creation.

## Development tools, testing and evaluation
It also identifies the development tools, testing methodology, and evaluation criteria for assessing the functionality and reliability of the application.
